# Minilith

A new way to make re-usable and composable components that can be shared cross domain, that put the control back into HTML the original declarative paradigm.

## problem statement

When the web was created HTML was a way to structure documents for the disseminating of information. Over the years we started sprinkling visual formatting & behavior (css & js). So as the amount of information put on the web grew, websites became as much a "How" you access, interact, and update information as the "What" information is being shown. Once the "How" became the focus for sites, backend languages, and tooling became more of a priority of a skill set. The industry saw a burst in monolithic MVC architectures where we could organize the "What" & "How" close the "Where" the underlying information/data was stored.
